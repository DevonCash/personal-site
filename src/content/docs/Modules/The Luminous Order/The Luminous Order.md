## The Reliquary at Harun

At the heart of a city built in its shadow, on the wreckage of the ancient empire of Harun on the planet of the same name lies an enormous construct whose infinite complexity and alien materials seem impossible to achieve. A sphere ten kilometers in diameter sits crouched, illuminating the paltry constructs below it with a terrible Light. Locals to this planet once worshipped it as a god, but those who knew better were able to see tha massive amounts of magic it leaked: magic of a form previously unknown to anyone.

## The Four Factions

Each faction channels the Light's power in unique ways that reflect their philosophies and objectives:

- **The Keepers** maintain vast archives within their endless Library, seeking to understand the fundamental nature of magic and reality itself.
- **The Mechanists** forge the future through innovation, combining magic and technology aboard their ancient forge-ship Jormungandr.
- **The Pathfinders** chart safe passages through the dangerous seas of wildspace, expanding the frontiers of known space.
- **The Wardens** protect the rights and welfare of all sentient beings, providing aid and maintaining order across the spheres.

## Lumina

The city over which it looms is now called Lumina, after the pure white light of the sphere.

## Reliquary Boons

The full members of each faction are granted the ability to shape the raw energy which seeps from the Reliquary. While the its true nature remains a mystery, each of the four factions are eager and able to channel the Reliquary's Light to their own ends. Working in harmony the four factions are nearly unstoppable, but their philosophical differences and competing priorities often lead to friction in times of peace.
