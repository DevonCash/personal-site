# Introduction

Welcome to *Luminous Order*, a toolkit for incorporating faction-based storytelling into your space-fantasy campaigns. This module provides flexible systems and structures for running games where powerful organizations compete and collaborate across the sea of stars, wielding both arcane technology and divine power in their pursuits.

Rather than presenting a fixed narrative, this toolkit offers scalable systems that support everything from simple mission-based play to complex factional politics. Players will find new character options in the form of Faction Boons - supernatural abilities granted by the Lumina Reliquary that provide advancement paths parallel to the normal class system. Whether you're running a single-faction party or managing a group with mixed allegiances, you'll find tools here to enhance your storytelling without constraining it.

The module is particularly suited for campaigns using the Spelljammer setting or similar space-fantasy frameworks, but its systems can be adapted for any setting featuring competing organizations with access to powerful magic.

## Using This Book

This module is organized into three main sections:

1. **The Luminous Order**: A comprehensive overview of the organization, its history, and the Lumina Reliquary that binds its factions together.

2. **The Four Factions**: Detailed information about each faction, including their philosophies, notable locations, key NPCs, mission structures, and Faction Boons that provide supernatural abilities to their members.

3. **Running the Game**: Practical guidance for DMs on implementing faction systems, creating missions, managing inter-faction dynamics, and scaling content for different party levels.

4. **Appendices**: Ready-to-use resources including maps, equipment lists, NPC statblocks, random tables for mission generation, and other tools to help bring the Luminous Order to life at your table.

Each section is designed to be modular - use what serves your campaign and modify or ignore the rest. The tools and systems presented here are meant to enhance your storytelling, not constrain it.
