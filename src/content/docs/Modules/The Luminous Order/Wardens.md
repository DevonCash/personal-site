## Primary Objective

Wardens use their blessings to the benefit of all through aid and defense of universal rights. While famous for their military arm, most Warden operations are concerned primarily with diplomacy and distribution of food and supplies.

## Core Principles

- Empathy
- Justice
- Temperance

## Members

The Wardens tend to attract those who wish to contribute to a larger cause. As Warden membership is not usually regarded in the same light as adherance to a god, many paladins and clerics can be found among their ranks.

## Leadership

The Wardens are directed by a single figurehead called The Will. The position is conferred via phrophetic dreams and verified using a series of Trials. Traditionally, the Will appoints council members to serve as advisors and lieutenents for the various branches of the Wardens

## Reputation

## Base of Operations

## Boon

Sigil of Service – A magical mark that is the symbol of service to [[Tabletop Games/5e/Dark Matter – Guardians/Lumina]]. The sigil can be etched or engraved on a piece of equipment, allowing it to channel the blessings of [[Tabletop Games/5e/Dark Matter – Guardians/Lumina]].
