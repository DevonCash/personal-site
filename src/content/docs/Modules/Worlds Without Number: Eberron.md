title: "Words Without Number: Eberron"
---
## What is this?

 Eberron is a magitech setting with a focus on intrigue and adventur featuring elements of noir, pulp, and high fantasy fiction. The continent of Khorvaire is recovering from a century-long war, which culminated in a disaster the likes of which never before seen. Magic is a part of everyday life in most places here, with magic items and artifice taking the place of devices that might run on electricity in our world. Worlds Without Number (WWN) is an OSR dungeon crawling game by Sine Nomine. The stock setting for WWN is an apocalyptic world where magic is no longer as reliable as it used to be.

 This document is a mechanical conversion of the player character options available in Eberron into Worlds Without Number. The overall versatility of these options has been reduced slightly in order to fit better alongside WWN's existing magic traditions, and the Artificer class has been split into two separate traditions â€“ use the WWN Adventurer class with two different Mage paths to get the full package.
