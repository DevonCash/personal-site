Ex Nihilo is a roleplaying game about heroes who grow through their deeds. Like legendary heroes of old, characters prove themselves through mighty acts that become part of their story. The game requires only a twenty sided die (d20) and can be played with or without a character sheet.

### Creating Your Character

To create your character, answer **three questions** about who they are. Each answer should be a sentence or two that fits the tone and scale of the story you want to tell.
Work with your GM to get a sense of the setting and themes of the game, and develop a background that fits in the world.

First, **who are you?** This establishes your identity and place in the world. "I am Beowulf, thane of the Geats," tells us both your name and your position among your people.

Second, **what do you do?** This defines how you approach challenges. Beowulf might say "I prove myself through contests of strength and courage," showing how he faces the world.

Finally, **why are you here?** This connects you to the immediate story. "I have come to aid Hrothgar against the monster plaguing his hall" gives both purpose and direction to your tale.

### Taking Action

When you face a challenge worthy of a hero, describe what you want to do. The GM will tell you the difficulty of your action: **Normal (10+)** for tasks that challenge ordinary people, **Difficult (15+)** for those that would test even a hero, or **Almost Impossible (20+)** for feats at the edge of mortal capability. When Beowulf seeks to wrestle Grendel, attempting to match the monster's inhuman strength with his own, this would be Almost Impossible.

To attempt the action, roll your **d20**. Your **background** - who you are, what you do, and why you're here - might help you. If your background applies, add **2** to your roll. As a thane who proves himself through contests of strength, Beowulf would add 2 to his wrestling attempt. If you've performed a similar **legendary deed** before (more on that later), add **5** instead. Use only the highest bonus if multiple could apply. If you've **mastered** this type of action through previous deeds, you succeed automatically.

### Your Growing Legend

When you roll above **20** on a check, you've performed a **legendary deed**. Write down exactly what you did - this becomes part of your character's growing legend. When Beowulf succeeds in his wrestling match, he might record "Grappled with Grendel, matching the monster's strength with mortal might."

A well-recorded feat captures three things: the **specific action** you took, what made it **challenging**, and **how** you accomplished it. This helps everyone understand what sorts of actions your legend encompasses. Beowulf's feat tells us he can wrestle monsters (the action), that he faced inhuman strength (the challenge), and that he relied on his own physical might (the method).

When you attempt something similar to one of your legendary deeds, add **5** to your roll. Later, when Beowulf faces Grendel's mother, his experience wrestling monsters would aid him. If you achieve another legendary success (rolling over 20) with a such an action, you've **mastered** that type of deed. When Beowulf succeeds legendarily again at monster-wrestling, he masters this type of feat. Once you've mastered a type of action, you succeed at similar attempts **automatically**, i.e. without rolling a check. At the end of his story, Beowulf would automatically succeed at wrestling monsters, while finding new challenges in tasks that require different approaches.

### Example Character: Beowulf

**Background**

- Who are you? I am Beowulf, thane of the Geats and king of my people
- What do you do? Prove myself through contests of strength and courage
- Why are you here? I am here to face the dragon that threatens my kingdom

**Deeds**

- Grappled with Grendel
- Held breath for a day in the mere
- Mastered wrestling monsters (Wrestled Grendel's mother)
- Shattered giant-forged sword on Grendel's mother's scales
- Mastered finding weak points (Struck through dragon-fire)

<Aside type='tip' title="Heroic Epithets">
 One way to capture your growing legend is through **heroic epithets**. These are short phrases that describe your deeds in a way that can be easily remembered and recited. Beowulf might be known as "Grendel's Bane" or "Dragon-Slayer" based on his deeds.

## Running Ex Nihilo

### Calling for Checks

A core principle of Ex Nihilo is that every check represents an opportunity for growth and legend-making. As such, make sure to call for checks only when three essential conditions are met:

First, the character must have a **genuine chance to fail**. If success is guaranteed or the action is trivial given the character's established capabilities, no check is needed. A legendary warrior who has mastered swordplay need not roll to best common soldiers.

Second, **success must be possible**. If an action truly exceeds the bounds of what's achievable in your setting, narrate the impossibility rather than calling for a roll. No mortal, no matter how skilled, can catch the moon in their hands.

Third, the action must reach **beyond the character's direct control**. Checks test the hero against forces, beings, or circumstances that can actively oppose them. Simple actions that only affect the character or their possessions rarely require checks.

These principles serve both practical and thematic purposes. Practically, they keep the game focused on meaningful challenges. Thematically, they ensure that each roll represents a true test of heroic ability – a moment where legend might be made. Since characters can only grow through legendary successes (rolling above 20), every check within their area of expertise carries the potential for advancement.

When in doubt, consider whether failure and success would both lead to interesting developments in the story. If either outcome would fall flat or feel unsatisfying, you might be better served by narrating the result rather than calling for a check.

### Setting Difficulties

When a player attempts an action, determine its difficulty based on the scale of the challenge:

**Normal (10+)** represents tasks that would challenge ordinary people. While difficult for common folk, these challenges are within reach of anyone who puts their mind to it. Climbing a castle wall, tracking a creature through the wilderness, or recalling ancient lore might all be Normal challenges.

**Difficult (15+)** marks feats that would test even a hero. These challenges push beyond ordinary human limits into the realm of legend. Wrestling a bear, leaping between rooftops, or deciphering a forgotten language might be Difficult challenges.

**Almost Impossible (20+)** encompasses feats at the edge of mortal capability. Success at these challenges marks one as truly legendary. Holding back a giant's blow, surviving a dragon's breath, or solving an ancient puzzle box might be Almost Impossible challenges.

### Genre and Scale

Ex Nihilo adapts to different genres by adjusting what counts as legendary. In mythic fantasy, wrestling a giant might be Almost Impossible, while in noir fiction, uncovering a vast conspiracy could be equally legendary. Consider three elements when setting your game's scale:

First, **establish what normal people can achieve**. This sets the baseline for Normal challenges and helps define when legendary deeds begin. In a supernatural horror game, simply surviving an encounter with the unknown might be worthy of legend. In high fantasy, the same encounter might be merely Difficult.

Second, **determine what marks someone as heroic** in your setting. These become your Difficult challenges - feats that separate heroes from common folk. In a game about monster hunters, tracking legendary beasts might start as Difficult before becoming routine through mastery.

Third, **define the upper limits of achievement**. These Almost Impossible challenges represent the difference between heroes and legends. When faced with these challenges, success should feel momentous, marking a clear step in the character's growing legend.

### Examples of Play

**Mythic Fantasy**

In a mythic fantasy setting, legends are made through **physical prowess** and **mighty deeds**. Normal folk might be skilled warriors or clever scouts, but heroes stand apart through **supernatural might**. The path from hero to legend often involves confronting ever-greater monsters and challenges, proving oneself against forces of nature and myth alike.

*Player: "I want to stop the giant from reaching the village."*

*GM: "The giant towers above you, each step bringing destruction closer to the village. How do you mean to stop something three times your size?"*

*Player: "I am Beowulf's heir – I'll plant my feet and catch its charge like my ancestor caught Grendel."*

*GM: "That would be **Almost Impossible (20+)**, but your lineage [**Background +2**] runs true in your veins..."*

**Noir**

In noir fiction, legends are built through **insight** and **determination** rather than raw power. While ordinary detectives might solve straightforward cases, heroes pierce deeper deceptions and uncover hidden truths. The path to legendary status involves seeing through ever-more elaborate schemes, with mastery marked by an almost supernatural ability to sense corruption and deception.

*Player: "I'll investigate the warehouse."*

*GM: "The warehouse seems ordinary, but your instincts say otherwise. The guard patterns, the shipping manifests, the worker schedules – what catches your eye as out of place?"*

*Player: "I'm looking for inconsistencies in their patrol routes, like I did with those gang territories."*

*GM: "Go ahead and roll a check for me; it'll be **Normal (10+)** difficulty, but your experience with the gangs **[Deed +5]** will help you here..."*

**Cyberpunk**

In a world where technology reshapes reality itself, legends arise from those who can bend the **digital** and **physical** realms to their will. While ordinary hackers might breach corporate firewalls or street techs might install basic augments, heroes rewrite the fundamental rules of cyberspace and flesh. The path to legendary status means pushing technology beyond its intended limits, turning systems and augmentations to purposes their designers never imagined possible.

*Player: "I need to crack this secure facility's defense system."*

*GM: "The ICE is bleeding-edge military tech, with routines that adapt and evolve. What's your angle of attack?"*

*Player: "Remember that neural feedback trick I developed against the yakuza's systems? I'll use my own augments to create a resonance loop, make the ICE see itself as an intruder."*

*GM: "You have **mastered** system subversion – tell me how you turn their security against itself..."*
