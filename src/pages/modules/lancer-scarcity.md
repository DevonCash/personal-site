title: "LANCER: Scarcity"
description: A rules module for LANCER offering guidance on operations without easy access to printers.
---

A lancer campaign set on the partially glassed ruins of a planet. Our hero lance was unable to make evac and have been left stranded on a planet as it undergoes orbital plasma bombardment. The players must fight to establish manufacturing capability on planet and secure a launch pad in order to escape.

Hex-crawl sandbox which allows players to unlock systems and weapons as reserves.

Reserve weapons and systems last until they are destroyed.

Patterns are divided up by license level and manufacturer (3 license levels x 4 manufacturers = 12 pattern sets). Pattern sets can be recovered as primary or secondary mission objectives from a variety of locations.

Mechs can be equipped from any patterns that have been unlocked so long as the pilot has an appropriate number of system points to operate them.

OPTION: Frame Scarcity
  Frames are finite / printer scale is not large enough to create them. Each frame must be acquired as loot. The lance starts with enough GMS Everest frames for each of them. If a frame is destroyed, it cannot be recovered.

OPTION: Pilot Roster
  The Lance can recover additional units from a variety of holdouts on the map. Each of these units are capable of piloting a mech, and their license level is increased every time they complete a mission. Each player drafts one of these units every time they embark on a mission. When a pilot dies, they are dead for the remainder of the game.

Act 1: Initialization
Mission 1 - EVAC
  Get your lance through a gauntlet of enemies to your designated evac point. Once the evac point is reached, the puddlejumper comes into view and is taken out by orbital ordinance. Campaign begins.

Mission 2 - Home Sweet Home
  Lance uncovers a bunker with a built in printer, but the halo of ferromagnetic debris around the planet has cut it off from the usual network of communications that furnish it with plans. Patterns can be retrieved from locations on the map.

Mission 3 - The Puddlejumper
  Lance must recover the wreckage of their downed landing craft and see if its pilot survived the wreck. She did.

Act 2: The Open World
