## Using and Acquiring Hardsuits
The suits listed here are not normally sold to the general public, but will be made available to any pilot with at least one mech license with the appropriate company.

## IPS-N
IPS-N's history of shipping and cargo handling has fueled the creation of an industrial suit platform to improve worker safety and efficacy. One of the oldest series of suits on the market, IPS-N's "Longshore" frame has been adapted to fit the needs of dock workers and ship-board mercenary defense forces alike.

Every suit based on IPS-N's "Longshore" platform is equipped with their **Active Lift Assist** system, which enhances personal strength and provides minor protection against crushing injuries.

### 7-League Hardsuit
Built to tackle thin catwalks and unstable terrain, the 7-League Hardsuit extends the Longshore platform with a miniaturized version of IPS-N's Nelson line of auto balancing stabilizers. The patented **Rapid Adjust Stabilizers** help you keep your feet, no matter where you're going.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1     | +3      | 8         | 8       | 4      |

**Effects:**
- **Active Lift Assist:** Greatly increases pilot carry strength. Attacks using medium melee weapons can be made as a Quick Action
- **Rapid-Adjust Rebalancer:** Internal gyroscopes and leg positioning systems allow you to ignore difficult terrain

**Actions:**
- **Longstride (Quick Action):** Move your speed. This movement ignores engagement

### Halyard Hardsuit
Specialized for low-G environments, the Halyard Hardsuit from IPS-N makes station-side cargo transfer a breeze. Skilled operators can maneuver and manipulate using the built in high strength cable grapple system, letting your personnel do more, faster.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1     | +3      | 8         | 8       | 4      |

- **Pull (Quick Action):** Initiate a grapple up to Range 4

### Ironclad Hardsuit
The first combat variant of the Longshore platform is built for endurance. IPS-N's Ironclad hardsuit is well suited for close quarters defense in the tight quarters of a long-haul vessel. In addition to the standard Longhore Active Lift Assist's combat applications, users can activate the Ironclad entrenchment system. From stopping bullets to surviving depressurization events, the Ironclad will make sure you come out on the other side.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1     | +3      | 8         | 8       | 4      |

**Effects:**
- **Active Lift Assist:** Greatly increases pilot carry strength. Attacks using medium melee weapons can be made as a Quick Action

**Actions:**
- **Lockdown (Full Action):** Until the start of your next turn, you have resistance to kinetic damage and cannot be moved by anything smaller than Size 2

## Smith-Shimano Corps (SSC)
SSC's approach to hardsuit design reflects their mastery of hostile environment navigation. While other manufacturers focus on brute force solutions, SSC's "Wayfarer" line emphasizes adaptation and environmental mastery. Each suit incorporates their groundbreaking **Freedom of Movement Suite**, ensuring pilot mobility across the most challenging terrains of newly-discovered worlds.

### Woodnymph Hardsuit
First tested in the dense canopies of frontier worlds, the Woodnymph exemplifies SSC's philosophy of environmental integration. Its advanced camouflage systems and sound dampening technology were perfected by xenobiologists studying hostile wildlife, making it equally suited for exploration or infiltration.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 0     | +0      | 10        | 10      | 5      |

**Effects:**
- **Freedom of Movement Suite:** When you Boost, you can fly your speed. You must end this movement on a surface or fall
- **Silhouette Obfuscation Layer:** You can hide while in **Soft Cover** or **Obscured**

**Actions:**
- **Active Camouflage (Quick Action):** You become **invisible** until you boost or take damage

### Painted Lady Hardsuit
Taking its name from Earth's most graceful butterflies, the Painted Lady creates a perfect synthesis between pilot and environment. Its quantum tunneling system allows surveyors to bypass environmental hazards, while its enhanced sensor suite ensures no danger goes unnoticed in newly-charted territories.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 0     | +0      | 10        | 10      | 5      |

**Effects:**
- **Freedom of Movement Suite:** When you boost, you can fly your speed. You must end this movement on a surface or fall

**Actions:**
- **Target Marker (Quick Action):** Apply the **Lock-On** effect to one target you can see within Range 5
- **Blink (Quick Action, Limited 1):** You teleport to a space within Range 2d6

### Harvester Hardsuit
Developed for extreme environment research teams, the Harvester represents SSC's commitment to keeping personnel at a safe distance from unknown threats. Its field manipulation systems allow for careful study of hazardous specimens, while its magnetic defense grid has saved countless lives from unexpected hostile reactions.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 0     | +0      | 10        | 10      | 5      |

**Effects:**
- **Freedom of Movement Suite:** When you Boost, you can fly your speed. You must end this movement on a surface or fall
- **Long Range Manipulators:** You may pick up and manipulate objects within Range 2

**Actions:**
- **Mag Parry:** **1/round**. You may attempt to parry an attack that would deal kinetic damage to you or an adjacent ally. Roll 1d6: on a 5+ the attack misses. This effect does not stack with invisibility

## HORUS
HORUS hardsuits defy conventional classification, each representing a different cell's interpretation of human enhancement. The only common thread is the integration of their notorious **Subjectivity Enhancement Suite** - though trying to find two implementations that work the same way is an exercise in futility. 

### Beelzebub Hardsuit
A meditation on the nature of self and swarm, the Beelzebub suit disassembles conventional notions of personal space. Its cloud of nanomachines operates as both shield and weapon, though some pilots report the "flies" occasionally act with unsettling independence.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 0     | +3      | 10        | 10      | 4      |

**Effects:**
- **Integrated SES:** A Subjectivity Enhancement Suite is integrated into all HORUS hardsuit designs

**Actions:**
- **Cloud of Flies (Full Action):** You and allies adjacent to you gain **Soft Cover** until the start of your next turn
- **Nanite Swarm:** Medium [Nexus, Smart]
  - Range 5, 2 kinetic damage

### Mimir Hardsuit
A radical experiment in consciousness integration, this HORUS design preserves functionality beyond conventional system limits. The sarcophagus system allows an NHP to persist and provide guidance even after conventional systems would fail, though what transpires in that gel-matrix interface remains known only to its users.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 0     | +3      | 10        | 10      | 4      |

**Effects:**
- **Integrated SES:** A Subjectivity Enhancement Suite is integrated into all HORUS hardsuit designs
- **Sarcophagus:** A full body gel computation layer provides sufficient processing power to host a full NHP operating in low power mode. While equipped in the suit the functionality of the NHP is reduced to that of a COMP/CON unit, though personality remains
- **Marionette:** When the pilot is **Down and Out** the hardsuit can continue to operate, taking one Quick Action per round

### Aboleth Hardsuit
A testament to HORUS's conviction that the barriers between systems are more social construct than physical law. Its invasion protocols don't so much hack enemy systems as convince local spacetime that they were always under the pilot's control.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 0     | +3      | 10        | 10      | 4      |

**Effects:**
- **Integrated SES:** A Subjectivity Enhancement Suite is integrated into all HORUS hardsuit designs
- **Dominate:** When jockeying, you gain an additional option:
  - The jockeyed mech must make a Barrage attack against its closest ally

**Actions:**
- **Invade (Full Action):** Perform the Invade Quick Tech on one valid target within Range 5

## Harrison Armory
Harrison Armory approaches hardsuit design with the same philosophy that drives their weapons manufacturing: overwhelming force precisely applied. Their "Commander" line of hardsuits emphasizes tactical superiority through superior firepower and defense. Each suit incorporates their signature **Tactical Storage** system, ensuring their operators never lack for tools of war.

### Kutuzov Hardsuit
A masterwork of battlefield control, the Kutuzov embodies Harrison Armory's doctrine of area denial. Its advanced incendiary systems ensure that if an operator can't hold ground, they can ensure no one else will either.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 2     | +3      | 10        | 10      | 3      |

**Effects:**
- **Tactical Storage:** Modular storage systems allow you to carry an additional piece of pilot gear when loading out

**Actions:**
- **Scorched Earth (Quick Action, Limited 3):** Spend a charge to gain one of the following effects until the start of your next turn:
  - When you take damage, all targets within Range 1 take 2 burn
  - Any attack you make which deals energy damage also inflicts 1 burn

### Atilla Hardsuit
The Atilla hardsuit exemplifies Harrison Armory's philosophy of mobile warfare. Its JAVELIN targeting system allows operators to maintain accurate fire even during rapid repositioning, making it a favorite among shock troops.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 2     | +3      | 10        | 10      | 3      |

- **Tactical Storage:** Modular storage systems allow you to carry an additional piece of pilot gear when loading out
- **JAVELIN Rapid Response Targeting Unit:** When you boost you may fire one weapon with the Sidearm tag as a free action

### Leonidas Hardsuit
A frontline defensive specialist, the Leonidas excels at creating chokepoints where they're needed most. Its ENCLAVE shield system projects defensive fields that can turn any position into an instant fortification, perfectly suited for Harrison Armory's territorial ambitions.

| Armor | Health | E-Defense | Evasion | Speed |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 2     | +3      | 10        | 10      | 3      |

**Effects:**
- **Tactical Storage:** Modular storage systems allow you to carry an additional piece of pilot gear when loading out

**Actions:**
- **ENCLAVE Infantry Shield (Limited 1, Deployable):** Zone Range 1. Attacks aiming into or through the zone gain 1 difficulty
