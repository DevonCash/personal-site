Welcome to *The Luminous Order*, a drop-in module containing details of a powerful interstellar organization that can be used to enhance your Dungeons & Dragons campaign.

This toolkit offers provides a layer of scaling systems that fit nicely over top of the existing class system in 5th Edition. Players will find new character options in the form of Faction Boons - supernatural abilities granted by the Lumina Reliquary that provide advancement paths parallel to the normal class system. Whether you're running a single-faction party or managing a group with mixed allegiances, you'll find tools and inspiration to tell your story.

The module is particularly suited for campaigns using the Spelljammer setting or similar space-fantasy frameworks, but its systems can be adapted for any setting featuring competing organizations with access to powerful magic â€“ you'll just need to do some tweaking.

## Using This Book

This module is organized into four broad sections:

1. **The Luminous Order**: A comprehensive overview of the organization, its history, and the Lumina Reliquary that binds its factions together.

2. **The Four Factions**: Detailed information about each faction, including their philosophies, notable locations, and the Boons that provide supernatural abilities to their members.

3. **Running the Game**: Practical guidance on implementing factions, creating missions, managing inter-faction dynamics, and scaling content for different party levels.

4. **Appendices**: Ready-to-use resources including equipment lists, NPC statblocks, random tables for mission generation, and other tools to help bring the Luminous Order to life at your table.

This entire module is designed to be used piecemeal or as a whole, depending on your needs! Plunder with wild abandon, and remember that originality is the art of concealing your sources.
