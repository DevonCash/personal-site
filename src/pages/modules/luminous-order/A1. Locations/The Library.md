title: The Library
---

The apparently endless demi-plane that acts as the Keeper's center of operations. Connected to the rest of the galaxy via a complex system of teleportation circles, only Keeper initiates are allowed in the library.

Areas within the Library have been settled and categorized by Keeper Librarians, and can be accessed for reference material by initiates. Unexplored regions of the library are chaotic dungeons filled with the fantastic forgotten knowledge of a long dead god, as well as the creatures that gorge on its corpse. Unknowable dangers lurk in the depths.
