title: WCS Radiant Shield
---

The WCS Radiant Shield is an enormous colony ship created and maintained by the Wardens as a base of operations.

## The Hall

An enormous feasting hall in which the wardens serve communal meals.

## The Arena

A large pit of compacted sand used for large gatherings and tournaments among the wardens.

## Greensward

A vast expanse of gardens that take up much of the ships deckspace, the greensward is dedicated to supplying the ship and creating excesses to aid colony worlds whose fields have gone fallow. Much of the agricultural space of the Greensward is also used for meeting spaces and classrooms. The Greensward is tightly climate controlled, with rolling bands of seasons that slowly creep around the space.

In the event the ship needs to take on a large number of refugees, the Greensward is used for housing and feeding guests.
