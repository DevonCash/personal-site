## Primary Objective

The Mechanists exist to invent and build designs necessary to fulfill the goals of the  [[Omnius]]. Technology both magical and mundane is used to provide equipment and logistical support to the other factions.

## Core Principles

- Keep It Simple Stupid
- Overbuild It Just In Case
- Never Do Somthing Three Times

## Members

The Mechanists attract engineers and tinkerers of all skill sets. Usually mad-scientist types.

## Base of Operations

The Mechanists are based out of Jormungandr, an ancient and enormous dwarven Forge ship which crash-landed on one of the moons of the garden planet Rama, apparently decommissioning the intelligence which once

## Leadership

Day to day operations for the Mechanists are managed by YAMOD (**Y**et **A**nother **M**echanical **O**perations **D**irector), an arcane intelligence created by one of their most vaunted members, Hjoldr Leyweaver. Requests are left with YAMOD, to be claimed for bounties by enterprising Mechanists who are skilled enough to complete the tasks set before them. Most smaller scale rogue members and runaway experiments are dispatched by a small team of hyper-competent construct assassins affectionately known as "Quality Assurance"

## Reputation

The Mechanists are unilaterally recognized to be one of the most dangerous collections of sapient beings ever assembled in one place.

## Recruitment and Advancement

In holding with their disregard for structure, Mechanists do not have a formal process for recruitment; anyone is welcome to enter [[Jormungandr]] and take a task from YAMOD. Certain tasks require certifications which can be conferred by any other mechanist with that certification. While paying for these certifications is not explicitly forbidden, certified tasks which are failed are generally followed up on by QA.

## Boon

Hypermodular piece of equipment (eg the everlight from spiritfarer) that can be used for the purposes of creation or destruction
